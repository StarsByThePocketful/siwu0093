Project Title: Treasure Hunting Game

Overview:
This is a simple treasure-hunting game built on a fixed 6×6 grid. 
🎯 marks the start at the top‐left corner and 🏁 marks the finish at the bottom‐right corner.
Two types of treasure (five 🌸 and five 💎), are placed across the map, and all other tiles are grassland 🟩. 

Gameplay Mechanics:

•	The player moves by entering w/a/s/d for up/left/down/right, or types status to view current treasure counts. 
    The player can also type STOP to quit the game and show the current status. The command is case-sensitive.
•	If an invalid command is entered or a move would exceed the map boundary, 
    the system displays an error and prompts again until a valid command is given.
•	When reaching the finish 🏁, the player wins if they have collected at least three of each treasure type. 
    Otherwise, the game ends unsuccessfully.
